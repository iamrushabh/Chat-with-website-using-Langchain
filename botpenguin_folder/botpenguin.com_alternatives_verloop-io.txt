So, why you need a Verloop Alternative?
Lack of transparency: Verloop is very discreet about how much they charge and what features they give.
Enterprise-focused: Verloop only focuses on the enterprise. Their services might be useless for SMEs, startups, and e-commerce businesses.
Complex UI: Verloop is reported to be tough to use by its users. The process of creating a bot and chatflow might take a lot of time.
No marketing automation: You can’t use features like message broadcasting and drip sequences to generate leads.
No mobile app: Verloop doesn’t have a mobile app. So, you’ll find it difficult to connect with your customers on the go.
Developer dependency: For advanced customizations and complex integrations, you must depend on developers.
