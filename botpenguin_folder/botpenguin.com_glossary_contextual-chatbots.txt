What are Contextual Chatbots?
Contextual Chatbots are
virtual assistants
that are programmed to engage in human-like conversations with users, with the aim of providing personalized and efficient assistance.
Unlike traditional chatbots, which use pre-set responses to answer user queries, Contextual Chatbots use NLP and ML to understand the context of a conversation and respond accordingly.
They can handle complex queries, learn from user interactions, and provide a more human-like and personalized experience.
How do Contextual Chatbots work?
Contextual Chatbots work by analyzing user input, interpreting the context, and providing relevant responses. They use
NLP
to understand the meaning behind user queries and ML to learn from user interactions and improve their responses over time.
Contextual Chatbots can be built using a variety of programming languages and tools, such as
Python
, Dialogflow, and Microsoft Bot Framework. The process of creating a Contextual Chatbot involves defining the use case, designing the conversation flow, training the model, and integrating the chatbot into the desired platform.
When to use Contextual Chatbots?

How do they differ from traditional chatbots?
Traditional chatbots are rule-based, meaning that they follow a pre-defined script or set of rules to respond to user input. They typically can't understand the context of a conversation or provide personalized responses.
In contrast, Contextual Chatbots use
AI
and NLP to analyze user input and provide relevant, personalized responses. They can understand the intent behind a user's message, draw on previous interactions, and adapt to changing contexts.
How contextual chatbots enhance the user experience?
Contextual Chatbots use context to provide more personalized and relevant responses to users. They can understand the intent behind a user's message, draw on previous conversations, and adapt to changing contexts. This means that they can provide more accurate and helpful information, and create a more engaging user experience.
Examples of Contextual Chatbots in action:
1. Bank of America's Erica
Erica is a Contextual Chatbot used by Bank of America to provide banking and financial advice to customers. Erica can analyze users' financial information, understand their goals and priorities, and provide personalized advice and recommendations.
For example, if a customer asks Erica how they can save money on their monthly expenses, Erica can analyze their spending habits and offer tailored suggestions.
2. Duolingo's chatbots
Duolingo is a language learning app that uses Contextual Chatbots to provide conversational practice for learners. These chatbots can understand the user's level of proficiency, identify areas where they need to improve, and provide relevant practice exercises.
For example, if a user struggles with a particular grammar concept, the chatbot can provide additional practice exercises to help them master the concept.
3. H&M's Kik chatbot
H&M's Kik chatbot is a Contextual Chatbot that helps users find fashion inspiration and make purchase decisions. The chatbot can understand a user's fashion preferences and suggest outfits and items that match their style.
It can also provide personalized recommendations based on previous purchases and browsing history.
Best Practices for Contextual Chatbots
1. Designing a user-friendly chatbot interface
The design of the chatbot interface plays a crucial role in the user experience. A well-designed
interface
should be intuitive, easy to navigate, and provide clear instructions to users.
It's important to consider the target audience and ensure that the interface is accessible and user-friendly for all users.
2. Personalizing the user experience
Personalization
is key to providing a relevant and engaging user experience. Contextual Chatbots can use data such as user history, preferences, and behavior to provide personalized responses and recommendations.
This can help to build trust and loyalty with users, and improve their overall
satisfaction
with the chatbot.
3. Training the chatbot with relevant data
A Contextual Chatbot is only as good as the data it is trained on. It's important to provide the chatbot with relevant data and to continuously monitor and update the training data as needed.
This can help to ensure that the chatbot is providing accurate and helpful responses to users.
4. Continuous improvement and optimization
Contextual Chatbots require ongoing monitoring and optimization to ensure that they are providing the best possible
user experience
.
It's important to track key metrics such as
user engagement
, satisfaction, and conversion rates, and to use this data to make informed decisions about how to improve and optimize the chatbot over time.
