Reason to find a LiveChat alternative today!
Pricing: LiveChat’s agent-based pricing is a buzzkill for growing businesses. The per-agent cost for the Starter plan is $20, the Team plan is $41, and the Business plan is $59.
Glitchy App: LiveChat has an Android & iOS app to manage chatbots, but it is riddled with issues like frozen canned responses, chatting lags, etc.
Addons: The marketplace addons for LiveChat are primarily for 3rd party integrations. Many of them are paid, increasing the overall pricing pushing people to look for LiveChat alternative.
Complicated Integrations: LiveChat has a few direct integrations. So, users rely on marketplace add-ons that are a bit complicated for first-timers.
Pay up for features: You need to upgrade your LiveChat plan to get the basic features like tags, segmentation, reports, team creation, human handover, etc.
Analytics: The base plan has hardly any analytics or reporting capabilities to see your bot’s performance which motivates customers to look for LiveChat alternative.
