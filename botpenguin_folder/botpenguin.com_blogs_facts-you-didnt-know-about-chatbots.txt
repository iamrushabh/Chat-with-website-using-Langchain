Chatbots are a hot topic in the world of business. Experts predict that by 2022, 85% of all customer service interactions will be conducted via messaging—and those interactions will happen with a bot instead of a human.
That's because chatbots are designed to be fast and efficient at giving answers to common questions and can handle simple tasks like scheduling appointments or checking out from an online store.
But most people don't realize that chatbots are not just for customer service or marketing purposes. They also provide incredible value for employees by helping them complete everyday tasks more quickly and accurately than ever.
Here are seven facts about chatbots that might surprise you:
Consumers dig chatbots
Chatbots are getting better and better at mimicking human conversation. They're becoming so conversational that you might start thinking of them as friends.
One study found that roughly half of the consumers would like to interact with a chatbot rather than a human customer service agent.
And why wouldn't they? We expect chatbots to be more personal than ever before, which is precisely where AI technology is headed next.
As AI evolves, we'll see more natural language processing and response generation capabilities in our bots. It will not be just more pre-programmed responses but actual conversations between humans and machines!
Chatbots help scale sales effortlessly
Chatbots can help drive sales by answering questions and directing users to the right product.
They can help with providing recommendations. Moreover, bots can drive sales by sending push notifications, one of the most effective ways to get people's attention on social media.
Chatbots can also provide coupons, making it easy for customers to purchase from you at the moment instead of leaving the app or website they are already on.
Chatbots help with personalized marketing
It can help with personalized marketing.
Chatbots can be a great way to customize your message and connect with your audience personally if you're targeting a specific audience.
It is especially true if you offer different products or services to different customers, like being able to tailor the messaging for each one.
It depends on how well you know what your customers want. Using data from previous conversations will help ensure that each experience feels explicitly tailored for them.
Chatbots are about more than customer service
There are many ways that chatbots can help your business.
They're great for customer service, but businesses can also use them for sales, employee engagement, marketing, and more.
Chatbots can also help engage employees
Chatbots are also a great way to engage your employees because they can help you with your staff's day-to-day tasks, personal lives, and health and well-being.
Customers want to talk to chatbots
Consumers love to talk with chatbots.
Why? Because they can do things like answer questions, make recommendations, and provide information.
They're more efficient than humans. They're also more convenient for customers who don't have time for human interaction because they can access the service anytime and anywhere.
Every customer deserves to be listened to, and chatbots give them that space and listen with great consideration.
Chatbots will continue to increase in the coming years
Chatbots are here to stay, and they're just getting started.
In the years to come, we can expect chatbots to take on more and more roles in our daily lives.
As artificial intelligence continues to improve and interactivity becomes increasingly natural for users, we will likely see a lot of new uses for chatbots.
Chatbots are already making their way into marketing campaigns. They've been used by brands such as Microsoft and Budweiser during the Super Bowl.
Bots are here to stay
Chatbots are here to stay because they offer several benefits to businesses and users. For businesses, chatbots can provide a cost-effective and efficient way to handle customer inquiries and support requests.
They can be available 24/7 to quickly answer common questions and help resolve issues, freeing up human customer service agents to handle more complex tasks.
Additionally, chatbots can be integrated into a company's website or messaging platforms, making them easily accessible to customers.
For users, chatbots provide a convenient way to get the information they need quickly and easily. They make it so much easier for customers to find what they're looking for, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Chatbots are here to stay because they offer a valuable service to both businesses and users.
As technology improves, chatbots will become even more sophisticated and able to handle a wider range of tasks, further solidifying their role in the customer service landscape.
Conclusion
According to a survey by Oracle, 66% of consumers are likely to buy from a company with a chatbot.
Remember that chatbots are great for sales and marketing, but they're meant to supplement human interaction.
They should instead be used as tools by customers or employees who want more information or help on their own time.
