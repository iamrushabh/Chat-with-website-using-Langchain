In a contact center, it typically includes the time spent on the phone, live chat, or email, depending on the channel of communication. It tells you how efficiently your service agents are handling customer queries or complaints.\nThe Formula\nCalculating AHT isn't rocket science. Just add up the total handling time (including any relevant after-call work) for a given period and divide it by the number of resolved customer interactions during that same period.\nAHT = (Total handling time for resolved interactions) / (Total number of resolved interactions)\nKey Components\nAHT comprises\nthree\nmain components: talk time, hold time, and after-call work. Let's break them down:\nTalk time:\nThe actual time spent conversing with the customer\nHold time:\nThe time a customer spends on hold\nAfter-call work:\nTime spent by the agent on follow-ups, documentation, or any other tasks related to the interaction\nApplication Across Communication Channels\nAHT isn't confined to phone calls or contact centers. It can be applied to any customer interaction, such as\nlive chat\n, email, or\nsocial media messaging\n. The essence remains the same: measuring the efficiency of your\nservice agents\n.\nAI Chatbot: Making Business Smarter\nGet Started FREE\nImportance of Average Handling Time\nCustomer Satisfaction\nProviding a prompt response to customer queries can improve satisfaction levels. By keeping an eye on AHT, you can ensure that your customers don't feel like they\u2019ve been stuck on a never-ending call or chat.\nOperational Efficiency\nA low AHT means your agents are resolving queries efficiently, allowing your business to serve more customers without increasing resources. It's simple math: when your service team can handle\nmore interactions\n, you maximize operational efficiency without having to hire more reps.\nBenchmarking Performance\nAHT is an indispensable metric used for staff training, performance evaluation, or incentive schemes. It helps set benchmarks for your service team, providing a measure for improvement or a target to strive for.\nResource Management\nAs AHT reflects agent efficiency, understanding trends can help you make informed decisions regarding staffing, scheduling, and training, ensuring you have the right resources at the right time to deliver brilliant customer experiences.\nChallenges with Average Handling Time\nQuality vs Quantity\nKeeping AHT low must not come at the expense of quality. In an effort to resolve queries quickly, agents might compromise on delivering satisfactory solutions or understanding the customer's concerns. Striking the right balance is essential.\nUnequal Complexity\nNot all customer interactions are equal - some are more complex than others. Comparing agents' AHT without considering this factor may lead to unfair evaluation and missed opportunities for improvement.\nAgent Morale\nConstant pressure to lower AHT may lead to agent dissatisfaction or burnout. It\u2019s important to keep your team motivated and remember that every performance measure has its limits.\nChannel Differences\nDifferent communication channels\nmight have varied AHT expectations. Comparing AHT across channels without considering these differences can paint an inaccurate picture.\nStrategies to Optimize Average Handling Time\nTraining and Coaching\nAgent training and regular coaching are indispensable tools for reducing AHT. Providing your team with relevant knowledge, problem-solving skills, and tools can empower them to handle queries swiftly and effectively.\nUse of Technology\nHarnessing the right technology, like\nAI-powered chatbots\nor knowledge bases, can assist agents in accessing information, reducing hold times, and handling customer interactions more efficiently.\nStreamlined Processes\nOptimizing processes and reducing bureaucracy can help reduce AHT. For instance, minimizing approval delays or providing agents greater autonomy may speed up resolution without compromising\ncustomer satisfactio\nn.\nCall Routing and Skill-based Routing\nRouting\ncustomer queries to agents with the specific skills\nor knowledge required can result in faster resolution. It\u2019s all about connecting the right customer with the right agent to make the most of your team's expertise.\nMonitoring and Measuring Average Handling Time\nKey Metrics\nUnderstanding AHT trends requires monitoring relevant metrics. Alongside AHT, track First-Call Resolution (FCR),\nCustomer Satisfaction\n(CSAT), Net Promoter Score (NPS), and agent occupancy to get valuable insights into your team's performance.\nSetting Realistic Targets\nOptimizing AHT requires setting realistic and achievable targets for your team. These targets should take into account factors like agent skill level, complexity of queries, and\ncommunication channel\ndifferences, ensuring your team isn't hopping onto an uphill treadmill.\nConsistent Measurement\nConsistently measuring AHT over time can help identify patterns and trends that can be used to make data-driven decisions. Furthermore, comparing AHT across different periods, like seasons or campaigns, sheds light on the effectiveness of your strategies.\nBalance with Other Metrics\nWhile AHT is important, it's crucial not to focus on it in isolation. Strike a balance between AHT and other metrics to ensure customer satisfaction and agent happiness.\nFuture of Average Handling Time\nOmnichannel Approach\nA comprehensive understanding of AHT in the age of\nomnichannel\ncommunication is crucial. As\ncustomer preferences\nevolve, AHT must be measured across all channels to maintain service quality.\nRemote Working\nRemote work adds a layer of complexity to measuring AHT. Keeping your team connected, motivated, and productive in a remote work setup is essential for AHT optimization.\nAI and Automation\nAdvancements in\nAI\nand\nautomation\nwill influence AHT with tools like chatbots and\nvirtual assistants\n, making it essential for businesses to incorporate technology without sacrificing customer satisfaction.\nPersonalization\nThe future of AHT hinges on delivering\npersonalized experiences\ntailored to individual customer needs. Agents equipped with relevant knowledge and tools will be crucial for addressing customer queries swiftly and effectively.\nYour Business, Enhanced by Our AI Chatbot\nTry BotPenguin\nSuggested Reading:\nAverage Response Time: Significance & Factors\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat is Average Handling Time (AHT)?\nAverage Handling Time (AHT) is a metric that measures the average duration taken by a\ncustomer service representative\nto handle customer interaction, including talk time, hold time, and after-call work.\nHow do you calculate Average Handling Time?\nAHT is calculated by dividing the total handling time for resolved customer interactions by the total number of resolved interactions during a given period.\nWhy is Average Handling Time important?\nAHT is important for measuring\ncustomer servic\ne efficiency,\nimproving customer satisfactio\nn, benchmarking performance, and managing resources.\nWhat are some challenges in managing Average Handling Time?\nChallenges in managing AHT include balancing quality with quantity, considering the complexity of queries, maintaining agent morale, and accounting for channel differences.\nHow can I optimize Average Handling Time?\nTo optimize AHT, focus on agent training and coaching, use relevant technology, streamline processes, and invest in effective call routing and skill-based routing practices.\nBuild your first AI chatbot for FREE in just 5 minutes!\nGet Started FREE\nSurprise!
