Determine the Platform
Once you have defined the purpose and the persona, it's time to determine the platform or platforms where the chatbot will be deployed.
Will it be deployed on social media or messaging apps like
Facebook
Messenger, WhatsApp, or Telegram? Determining the platform will help you understand how to create a chatbot that fits the interface.
Use Appropriate AI and NLP Solutions
A chatbot that can communicate naturally and can understand complex commands would be more efficient and engaging.
