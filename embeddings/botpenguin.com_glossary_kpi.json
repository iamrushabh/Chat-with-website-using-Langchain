It should reflect the organization's objectives, be straightforward to understand and follow and offer insights for continuous improvement.\nHow many KPIs should a business have?\nThe number of KPIs primarily depends on the organization's size and goals. However, it is always advisable to keep them limited so that focus doesn't waver.\nGenerally, every business objective should have 1-2 related KPIs.\nShould KPIs be monetary?\nNot necessarily. While many KPIs do deal with financial aspects, many others revolve around non-monetary aspects such as customer satisfaction, employee churn, or project completion rate.\nCan KPIs change?\nAbsolutely! With changing business dynamics, KPIs, too need to be agile and flexible. They should be regularly reviewed, optimized, and updated where necessary.\nHow often should KPIs be reviewed?\nThis depends on the nature of the KPI and the organization's preference. Some KPIs need daily tracking (like sales), some monthly (like turnover rate), and some yearly (like market share).\nMore than the timing, what matters is the regular and consistent review of KPIs.\nBuild your first AI chatbot for FREE in just 5 minutes!\nGet Started FREE\nSurprise!
