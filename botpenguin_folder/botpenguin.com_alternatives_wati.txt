Why you should switch to Wati alternatives?
UniChannel: While omnichannel solutions cater to various platforms, Wati focuses specifically on WhatsApp, losing customers on other touch points.
Pricing: For only offering WhatsApp chatbots, Wati’s price of $360 for their base plan is steep for small businesses.
Limited Chatbots: Wati offers a different number of chatbots for each plan tier. Growth has 10 chatbots, Pro has 25, and Business has 50 chatbots.
Verified Tick: A verified profile immediately builds trust among customers. Wati charges $50 one time to enable you to earn that trust
Lack of Integration: Wati's base plan has only a few integrations, if any, for users to try. As a Wati alternative, BotPenguin offers 60+ integrations.
Not a High Volume Tool: The Wati Chatbot charges you based on sessions and agents, so it is not suited for business handling lots of leaders in a day.
