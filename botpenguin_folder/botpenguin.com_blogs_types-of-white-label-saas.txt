The rise of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) has revolutionized the way businesses operate, enabling them to access cutting-edge software solutions without the need for complex installations or extensive infrastructure.
White label SaaS products have emerged as a compelling opportunity for reselling businesses to offer customized, branded solutions to their clients.
According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global white label SaaS software market is expected to grow from $53.8 billion in 2022 to $87.6 billion by 2027, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10.3% during the forecast period (MarketsandMarkets, 2022).
This growth is driven by the increasing demand for cost-effective and flexible software solutions across various industries.
With a wide range of white label SaaS products available, reselling businesses can cater to diverse customer needs, from project management and customer relationship management (CRM) to email marketing and business intelligence tools.
By leveraging these white label SaaS solutions, resellers can provide their clients with tailored, branded experiences, fostering customer loyalty and enhancing their competitive edge.
So continue reading to know the top 11 types of white label SaaS for reselling business.
What is White Label SaaS?
White label SaaS refers to software developed by one company but branded and sold by another.
This allows businesses to offer additional services to their clients without having to develop the technology themselves.
Essentially, white label saas software is like buying a house you can put your name on and sell as if you built it from scratch.
Companies typically purchase a subscription from a white-label saas platform, then rebrand the software with their logos, colors, and other identifying elements.
A great example of white label saas products is email marketing platforms. A vendor develops the software, and various businesses can rebrand it to offer it as their solution.
This approach saves development time and costs while enabling companies to expand their service portfolios.
