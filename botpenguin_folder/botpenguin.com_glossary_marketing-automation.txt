When to Implement Marketing Automation?
1. Identifying the Need for Automation
Ask yourself the following questions:
Are you drowning in manual, repetitive marketing tasks?
Is it challenging to keep up with leads and customer data?
Are you struggling to measure the success of your marketing campaigns?

Start small and scale up: Gradually automate one process at a time, optimizing as you go.
