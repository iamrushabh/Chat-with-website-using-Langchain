These include:\nExcellent Open Rates:\nWhatsApp messages' open rates are more than 90%, more than three times as high as the average email campaign's. Indeed, this will ensure that your messages are not just sent but also read, mitigating the risk that the material will be lost in the digital void.\nReal-time two-way engagement:\nWhatsApp facilitates two-way conversations so the recipient can click to respond, ask a question, or request further information. Since this occurs in real time, all interactions feel more intimate and instantaneous than those typically email or SMS.\nAdvanced Automated Conversations:\nSmart Bots for Automatic Conversations can be built into WhatsApp, and you can use chatbots for hundreds of unique conversations at once. Active chatbots allow for smart, humorous, and human-like reactions, making them more efficient than standard programmed responses.\nComprehensive Insights:\nWhatsApp provides comprehensive insights about your audience, not just monitoring the open and click rates. You\u2019ll also be able to know who your audience is, how often they interact with your campaigns, and more. Such information would be genuinely helpful for customizing future discussions and knowing your recipient\u2019s.\nStreamlined Multi-Agent Chat Management:\nThe\nWhatsApp Business API\noffers multi-agent chat management. This implies that your team is allowed to run different chats simultaneously and that everything from WhatsApp is simpler than it appears. Everything is conducted using a single WhatsApp API number, with the assistance of the proper person.\nNow, imagine harnessing all these benefits seamlessly with a single, powerful tool.\nTo leverage these benefits effectively, BotPenguin's\nWhatsApp AI chatbot\nis an excellent tool, enabling bulk messaging, human-like customer support, lead generation, and appointment booking. This powerful tool ensures high engagement rates, real-time interactions, and comprehensive insights, making it an indispensable asset for effective WhatsApp marketing strategies.\nWhatsApp Automation\nCustomer Support\nLead Generation\nAppointment Booking\nSend Personalized Messages on WhatsApp\nto 10000+ Customers at Once!\nTry BotPenguin\nHow Brands Are Using WhatsApp Marketing?\nWhatsApp marketing has become a powerful tool for businesses, enabling them to turn messages into sales and make customers feel like VIPs.\nHere are some examples of how brands are leveraging WhatsApp for marketing:\nRenee Cosmetics\n2-Step Abandoned Cart Recovery:\nRenee Cosmetics uses a 2-step WhatsApp reminder for abandoned carts, recovering 64% of their carts. The second reminder converts 230% more than the first, demonstrating a deep understanding of consumer behavior in the cosmetics industry.\nHealth & Wellness Brand\nClick to WhatsApp Ads:\nA leading health and wellness brand effectively utilized\nClick to WhatsApp Ads\n, earning \u20b938.46 lakhs in revenue from an investment of \u20b913.39 lakhs.\nThe campaign helped them acquire 22,000 new leads, of which 3,800 became customers, highlighting the potential of integrating advertising with instant messaging platforms.\nSuggested Reading:\nHow to Grow Your Business Using WhatsApp Marketing Automation\nDermawear\nWhatsApp Popup Campaign:\nDermawear raked in 700X return on investment after retargeting leads acquired via website popups on WhatsApp.\nThis strategy underlines the effectiveness of integrating modern opt-in tools into traditional digital platforms, especially in the fashion and apparel industry.\nAuric\nCOD to Prepaid Conversion:\nAuric, an Ayurveda-inspired beauty and wellness D2C brand, launched a campaign to incentivize customers to prepay for their COD orders before they ship them.\nTheir strategic WhatsApp campaign converted 27% of COD orders to prepaid, significantly reducing logistical hassles and enhancing operational efficiency.\nDryza\nAbandoned Cart Recovery:\nDryza, an upscale fashion boutique, uses WhatsApp to drive an insane 1140x ROI.\nThey run a 4-step abandoned cart campaign to convert without offering any discount coupons, which could be a valuable lesson for high-AOV but lesser-known brands.\nAfter looking into WhatsApp marketing, you now think it's time to look at traditional marketing.\nWhat is Traditional Marketing?\nTraditional marketing is the practice of marketing products or services via offline platforms utilizing many conventional methods such as print, broadcast, direct mail, and outdoor advertising.\nTraditional marketing existed before digital marketing, leveraging existing mediums to reach target markets. Marketing strategies in conventional marketing terms include newspaper ads, TV commercials, radio ads, billboards, flyers, and brochures.\nTraditional marketing aims to continue attracting clients via mass interaction and follow-up while enforcing several key aspects that are exposed to it again. Even so, this kind of marketing delivers interactions limited to audience engagement compared to digital marketing.\nNow we will see the benefits of traditional marketing.\nImage Source: Naukri.com\nBenefits of Traditional Marketing\nTraditional marketing offers numerous advantages that continue to make it a valuable component of marketing strategies:\nTangible Presence:\nPhysical elements like brochures, business cards, and billboards offer a tactile angle that allows users to interact with the company face-to-face.\nWide Reach:\nTraditional marketing methods, such as broadcasting media such as television, radio, and print, can reach a wide and diversified audience irrespective of one's level of online feasibility.\nLocal Targeting:\nTraditional marketing methods like geotargeting can target specifically located business areas, making them ideal for businesses with a niche local market.\nEstablished Trust:\nConventional marketing channels such as Newspapers, magazines, and television have been the main way for brands to communicate with customers for long time and are highly popular among consumers, leading to trust and credibility.\nStrong Impact:\nPopular traditional marketing methods, like billboards with visual impact or advertising messages that are easily memorized and, therefore, lead to better brand recognition, can shape the right impressions in the public mind and help reach the desired goals.\nNext, we will see the types of traditional marketing.\nTypes of Traditional Marketing Channels\nMarketing methods of the past in general consisted of different physical channels designed for advertising.\nHere are eight types of traditional marketing channels:\nHandouts\nHandouts are printed materials that illustrate information such as a firm's advertising campaign, an event, or an offer. They can be given away at an event or other public places to build awareness and present information about a company or product.\nBillboards\nThe designs for billboards on major roads and highways carry advertisements and company logos that complement the visuals. They place pictures with short instructional messages into counterpart text that warrants the audience's memory, thus assisting in brand recall.\nDirect mail\nWith direct mail marketing, consumers receive newspapers, T.V. ads, radio, flyers, or letters at their homes. The mailings are sent to the addresses of potential customers within a target area.\nOpening a store right in a town will give an organization both its status and recognition. It will also help people know where they are exactly.\nPrint ads\nPrint ads afford companies more significant opportunities to reach potential customers through primary means, such as daily papers and journals. One useful way to advertise is to use newspapers or related magazines by showcasing more ads to create brand awareness and generate leads.\nEvent marketing\nMarketing that occurs during seminars, conventions, or conferences is one type of event marketing, where users are positioned to get the word out about the shown products or services.\nBeing a part of sponsorships and organizing information boards at various neighborhood occasions is another approach to achieving this.\nBroadcasting\nUsing a radio or a television for commercials is a good idea. One can achieve brand awareness at local or national level.\nEngaging ads can captivate viewers and listeners alike, and specially made advertisement copy might lure them into taking action, such as researching the company or contacting it for further information.\nCold calling\nCold calling or telemarketing involves calling potential clients to describe the goods or services offered and create a personal bond.\nProduct placement\nA product crash is the incorporation of a brand or product into the setting of a movie, television show, or other media format. After learning about both kinds of marketing, it's time to think about making an informed decision.\nSuggested Reading:\n10 Must-Have WhatsApp Marketing Tools for Your Business\nFactors to Consider When Choosing Between Whatsapp Marketing and Traditional Marketing\nChoosing between WhatsApp marketing and traditional marketing can take a lot of work for businesses.\nBoth methods have their own unique advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on various factors such as your target audience, budget, and marketing goals.\nHere are some key differences between WhatsApp marketing tool and traditional marketing to help you make an informed decision:\nTarget Audience and Preferences\nWhatsApp is especially preferred for reaching youthful, technology-skilled users and smart device users for whom messaging is frequent.

Old style marketing is usually better than the others for brand-building, the introduction of new items, or reaching a huge community.\nBudget and Resources\nWhatsApp marketing tool is the right approach for small companies, as there is no need to make a higher initial investment. Classical marketing, though, does need more cash for TV, radio, billboards, and similar efforts. This solution allows traditional marketing to gain more outreach and visibility at the same time.\nCompetition and Market Trends\nOther factors to consider when selecting a marketing strategy include your competition and market trends.\nFirst, examine your industry. Where are your competitors based, and how do they handle their marketing? If the majority of your industry needs to employ Whatsapp as a communication portal, it might be an opportunity for you to excel.\nHowever, if most of your industry uses Whatsapp, taking the traditional route could boost your influence.
