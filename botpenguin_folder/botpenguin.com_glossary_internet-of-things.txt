What is Internet of Things (IoT)?
The Internet of Things, or IoT for short, refers to the growing number of internet-connected devices and objects that can collect and share data. With IoT, physical things are embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity that allows them to connect and exchange data over the internet.
A simple example is a smart home device like a WiFi-connected thermostat. The thermostat can connect to the internet to pull in weather forecasts, adjust your home's temperature accordingly, and allow you to control it remotely using an app on your smartphone. So the thermostat is an internet-connected "thing" that is part of the IoT.
The IoT offers new ways to monitor, control, and interact with the physical world through the internet. As more appliances, vehicles, and objects become connected, the IoT will continue to grow and impact our daily lives in many ways.
Why is Internet of Things (IoT) Important?
IoT is more than a technological trend; it is an essential component shaping our future by impacting our day-to-day tasks, businesses, and major industries.
