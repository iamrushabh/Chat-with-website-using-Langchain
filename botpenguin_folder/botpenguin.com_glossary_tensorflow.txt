How does TensorFlow Work?
Source: GeeksforGeeks
Tensorflow uses a data flow graph to represent the computation in a
machine learning
model.
The graph consists of nodes and edges, where nodes represent mathematical operations and edges represent the flow of data. Here's a high-level overview of how Tensorflow works:
Tensorflow Workflow
Building a Computational Graph
: Developers define the computation graph by creating nodes and connecting them with edges.
Running a Session
: Developers create a session to run the computation graph and execute operations on the data.
Updating Variables
: Developers update the variables in the model based on the results of the computation.
Tensorflow Architecture
Source: Tensorflow
Tensorflow has a modular architecture that consists of several components. Here are the main components of Tensorflow architecture:
Tensorflow Architecture Components
Graph
: The computation graph is the core component of Tensorflow architecture. It represents the computation in a machine learning model.
Tensor
: A tensor is a multidimensional array that represents the data in a machine learning model.
Operation
: An operation is a mathematical operation that is performed on the data in a machine learning model.
Session
: A session is used to run the computation graph and execute operations on the data.
