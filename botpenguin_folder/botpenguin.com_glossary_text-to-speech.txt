What is Text to Speech (TTS)?
TTS is a technology that converts written text into spoken words. It uses algorithms that analyze the text and produce an audio output that sounds like natural speech. TTS can be used for a variety of purposes, such as providing an audio version of a written document, or enabling people with visual impairments to access written content. There are different types of TTS, including rule-based TTS and concatenative TTS.
TTS works by breaking down written text into individual units, such as words, syllables, or phonemes. It then uses a set of rules or algorithms to determine the pronunciation of each unit, and combines them to produce an audio output. TTS can also use pre-recorded speech segments to create a more natural-sounding output.
There are different types of TTS, including rule-based TTS, concatenative TTS, and statistical parametric TTS. Rule-based TTS uses a set of rules to determine the pronunciation of each unit, while concatenative TTS uses pre-recorded speech segments to create an audio output. Statistical parametric TTS uses machine learning algorithms to generate speech based on a large amount of training data.
