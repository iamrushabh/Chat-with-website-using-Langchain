So, why do you need a Yellow.ai alternative?
No transparency: Yellow.ai is a bit shy in disclosing their pricing upfront. To know what you’ll get and what you’ll pay for it, you’ll have to book a demo call first.
Steep learning curve: some Yellow.ai users have reported complexity in using their chatbot solutions. Though the chatbots are custom, they’re still hard to maneuver.
Enterprise-focused: Yellow.ai is so focused on serving enterprises that its offerings have become unreachable and quite useless for SMEs, e-commerce stores, and solopreneurs.
Stability Issues: Some Users have reported outages in Yellow.ai’s system, which are quite often. Such outages have resulted in a complete loss of SLAs.
No mobile app: Yellow.ai does not have a mobile app to connect with your customers wherever & whenever you want.
No WhatsApp Commerce: A big bummer for Yellow.ai is the lack of WhatsApp commerce features in their WhatsApp chatbot, like catalogs and payment collections.
