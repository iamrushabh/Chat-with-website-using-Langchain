Learn Voice Assistant Commands
Take the time to learn the various commands and features your voice assistant offers, so you can make the most of its capabilities and streamline your interactions.

Customize your voice assistant's settings to better suit your preferences, such as adjusting the voice, language, or accent, and linking your accounts for a more personalized experience.
Be Patient and Adapt
Voice assistants are constantly evolving and improving, so be patient when they don't understand you perfectly. Adapt your requests and commands as needed, and remember that with time, your assistant will likely become more adept at understanding you.
