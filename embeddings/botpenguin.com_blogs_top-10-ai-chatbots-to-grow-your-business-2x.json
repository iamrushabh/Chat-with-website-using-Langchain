Users do not want to wait for query or dispute resolution; they want to focus on more important things. Businesses that want to grow and be successful need to prioritize the customer's wishes.\nOne of the outcomes of this phenomenon is the use of chatbots by businesses and individuals. Chatbots invariably save time and money for all the stakeholders.\nAs of today, 1.4 billion individuals use chatbots to interact with businesses as well as other individuals. Companies create and use the most advanced AI chatbots to save customers' time and provide round-the-clock service.\nUses vary from one-to-one discussions with customers and staff to automating various functions such as sales, marketing, customer service, administrative and operational chores.\nAI chatbots and rules-based chatbots are the significant classifications of chatbots. Many companies adopted first-generation bots, which were strictly rule-based and provided poor user experiences. Rules-based chatbots can only handle relatively simple cases, whereas AI-based chatbots are far more complex.\nTop 10 AI Chatbot apps\nChatbots have become a necessity to attain growth, whether you own a small business or an enterprise. However, picking the best chatbot app can be difficult, especially when the landscape constantly evolves with so many options on the market. Here are the 10 best AI chatbot apps:\n1. BotPenguin\nBotPenguin is an AI-powered chatbot platform\nthat enables you to build chatbots without any coding. It is one of the best alternatives for small businesses due to the features provided in the free plan and low pricing. You can build chatbots for many businesses like education, healthcare, insurance, e-commerce, real estate, travel agencies, and more.\nIt lets users create chatbots that can start interacting with users and transfer the chat to live agents if they become stuck. The chatbot builder design is very appealing, and it is effortless to create a bot using the builder.\nThe chatbots can be integrated with Facebook, Telegram, Skype, Zapier, Shopify, Website, and more than 40 other third-party platforms. You can choose from a free version and two premium plans with unlimited features.\nGenerating Growth with Generative AI\nKnow More\n2. PandoraBots\nYou may use PandoraBots to extend your experience across practically all social media platforms.\nIt provides an application programming interface (API) that enables you and your programmers to connect your bot to almost any platform. Due to the nature of the application programming interface and integrations, PandoraBots is best suited for experienced computer operators and developers.\nIt has user-friendly features, but converting it to a do-it-yourself solution is complex. PandoraBots has more capabilities than other\nAI chatbot software\n.\n3. Botup\nBotup is a robust chatbot builder that helps to construct, design, and automate bots for\nFacebook Messenger\n,\nWhatsApp,\nand\nSlack\n, among other platforms. Botup should be chosen if you need a bot for automatic lead creation, smooth engagement, and easy conversions.\nIt offers a 30-day free trial. There's also a $14.99 per user unlimited suite subscription that gives you access to over 30 apps.\n4. Chatfuel\nIt works with both Facebook and Telegram. However, Facebook Messenger is more effective because of its 1 billion users than Telegram's 200 million.\nChatfuel creates your bot\nusing a template. It's easy to get started and install on the Messenger.\nFree plans have basic functionality and up to 1000 members. The pro plan costs $15 per month for paid customers. In contrast, the premium plan costs $300 per month and includes more users, more significant support, and white-labeled branding.\n5. ManyChat\nManyChat is a good alternative for businesses having a small audience but looking to scale because it offers a feature-packed free account. The paid plans start at $10 per month for 500 members and $145 per month for 25,000 users.\nBuilding a bot with\nManyChat is straightforward and quick\n. It doesn't require any code. Instead, it uses a drag-and-drop builder to establish chats, answers, and other vital settings in minutes.\nYou can then link to Facebook and have an automated list builder and a sales funnel. The main disadvantage is that it is limited to the Facebook platform.\n6. HubSpot Chatbot Builder\nHubSpot is a powerful and adaptable platform that works with SMS, email, Facebook Messenger, the web, and Slack. Because its flowchart setup style is well-suited for visual employees, project managers will find it undemanding and user-friendly right away.\nHubSpot enables you to respond to customer inquiries, qualify leads quickly, and schedule appointments with clients without hiring extra customer service personnel.\nPaid accounts start at $50 per month, $80 per month, and $3200 per month for the enterprise package. Hubspot helps you to combine all of your marketing efforts, including chatbots, into one platform.\n7. Chatbot\nIt works with Skype,\nFacebook\n, Twitter,\nSlack\n, Kik,\nLiveChat\n, and YouTube, allowing you to create bots that aid your clients with their service needs. It works with Chaat.io to give your bot superpowers like spam filters, automatic responses, and 24/7 customer service.\nTransferring a stuck client to a human agent is simple, but it requires an external account. It provides them with a link to an expert who can assist them if they get stuck. Reports include a 14-day trial and a $50 monthly subscription with 1000 chats, which will cost 1 cent for each discussion if it expires.\n8. ChatterBot\nIt includes the Python library, which enables users to create bots quickly. It's used to develop client-facing automated answers. Unlike other programs, it allows bots to communicate in any language.\nIts key advantage is the ease with which new developers may learn how to construct\nchatbots\nthat have more human-like dialogues using their online tutorial.\nAt the same time, this is more suited to people with technical know-how and not business owners.\n9. SAP Conversational AI\nDesigned for reporting and analytics at the enterprise level, it integrates with Facebook, Telegram, Skype, Kik, WhatsApp, and almost all messaging platforms.\nHas a lot of flexibility and resources when it comes to\nimproving customer service\n. Allows you to create an infinite number of requests for free at a rate of up to three per second.\n10. Sequel\nSource: Chatbot Academy\nFacebook, WhatsApp, Kik, LINE, Telegram, Slack, SMS, and Viber are among the platforms it supports. It emphasizes storytelling and editorial qualities, which are popular among online advertisers.\nIt allows users to start utilizing bot templates that have previously been created. A sequel can help you publish, influence, and expand your quiz or game.\nThe platform is free to use, but you must pay to access value-added services and features via the Sequel shop. It is what you need if you want to start on a low-risk basis because it is free. The main disadvantage is that their extra features are exorbitantly expensive.\nConclusion\nChatbots can help you achieve excellent productivity. The best AI chatbots for businesses are laser-focused on a single-use case, such as customer support, surveys, administrative duties, or sales. So, choose one from the above list and have your business grow 2x within no time.\nConnect, Engage, Convert\nGet Started FREE\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat are the top 10 AI chatbot apps to help grow my business?\nBotPenguin, PandoraBots, Botup, Chatfuel, ManyChat, HubSpot Chatbot Builder, Chatbot, ChatterBot, SAP\nConversational AI\nand Sequel are some popular AI chatbot apps you can use.\nHow can AI chatbot apps help grow my business?\nAI chatbot apps can automate customer support, engage website visitors, generate leads, provide 24/7 assistance, and personalize user experiences, ultimately helping you grow your business.\nAre AI chatbot apps easy to integrate with my business website?\nYes, most AI chatbot apps provide integration options with popular website platforms like WordPress, Shopify, and\nWix\n, making it easy to add the chatbot to your website.\nCan AI chatbot apps replace human support agents completely?\nWhile AI chatbots can handle many customer inquiries, it's best to have a combination of bots and human support agents to provide the best customer experience.\nDo I need coding skills to use AI chatbot apps for my business?\nNo, many AI chatbot apps offer a no-code or drag-and-drop interface, allowing you to build and customize chatbots without any coding knowledge.\nSubscribe to Our Newsletter\nGet the latest business insights straight into your inbox.\nEmail\nEnter your email address\n*\nSubscribe Now\nKeep Reading, Keep Growing\nCheckout our related blogs you will love.\nA Comprehensive Guide to AI Agentic Workflow for Businesses\nUpdated at Oct 31, 2024\n12 min to read\nBotPenguin\nContent Writer, BotPenguin\nExploring the Best Drift Alternatives for 2024: A Comprehensive Guide\nUpdated at Oct 29, 2024\n8 min to read\nBotPenguin\nContent Writer, BotPenguin\nBest Intercom Alternatives for 2024: A Comprehensive Guide\nUpdated at Oct 28, 2024\n5 min to read\nBotPenguin\nContent Writer, BotPenguin\nTable of Contents\nTop 10 AI Chatbot apps\nConclusion\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nBotPenguin is the best AI Chatbot maker platform.
