So, why you need a Chatbase alternative?
Very low customizations: You can only add a profile picture to your chatbot. That’s it. There’s pretty much nothing Chatbase allows you to do.
Confusing UI: Chatbase, though it boasts simplicity, has a confusing and complex user dashboard. That puts off a lot of users.
Hallucinating AI: Chatbase is yet to introduce an anti-hallucination measure in their AI Chatbot. It sometimes generates random or wrong responses.
Limited Use Cases: Chatbase’s simplicity plays against it. Their chatbots are reported (by users) to be limited to only certain use cases.
Not Omni-channel: Chatbot is yet to introduce Telegram, Instagram, Messenger, & Facebook chatbot. You can only use it on WhatsApp, the website, and Slack.
Limit on character length: Chatbase puts a limit on the character length of the chatbot’s responses. It limits the chatbot’s capability to interact with users.
