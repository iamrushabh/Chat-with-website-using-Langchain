Why you need a Botsify alternative today!
Pricing: The base plan is $490 annually and still lacks a WhatsApp chatbot. Plus, you can create only two chatbots. So. it’s not fit for businesses with high lead volume.
Professional Plan: The professional plan does have merits, but they are overshadowed by monthly pricing of $149.
No Visual Builder: Botsify has a block builder that limits your capacity to imagine and design smart conditional flows needed to convert your leads.
Custom Templates: Botsify has only 24 templates and restricts users from adding custom templates, limiting the chatbot customization according to business needs.
Lacks Native Integration: Botsify mostly has API-based integrations. Botsify alternatives like BotPenguin offer native integration with 60 applications.
No Built for eCommerce: Integration with platforms like WooCommerce, Shopify, and payment gateways is crucial for an eCommerce chatbot. Botsify lacks these essential integrations.
