Restart your device:

Check for updates:
Make sure your device and Alexa app are updated with the latest software updates. This can often solve connectivity issues and other problems.
Adjust the microphone sensitivity:
If Alexa has trouble hearing you, try adjusting the microphone sensitivity in the Alexa app settings.
Reset the device
