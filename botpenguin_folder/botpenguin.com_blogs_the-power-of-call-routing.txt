What is Call Routing?
Call routing
allows businesses to direct incoming calls to the appropriate person or department. It can be set up to route calls based on various criteria such as the time of day, the caller's location, or the purpose of the call.
For example, a customer calling a bank might be routed to the loan department if they are calling about a loan, or to the customer service department if they have a general inquiry.
