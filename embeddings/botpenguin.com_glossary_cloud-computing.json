technology that allows users to access and utilize computing resources, such as storage, processing power, and software applications, over the internet instead of relying on local hardware.\nIt enables businesses and individuals to scale their computing needs on-demand, without the need for investing in expensive infrastructure.\nSource: Spiceworks\nCloud computing offers numerous benefits, including cost savings, flexibility, and ease of use.\nUsers can access thei\nr data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection, making it a popular choice for remote work, collaboration, and data backup.\nMajor cloud service providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft\nAzure, and Google Cloud Platform.\nCloud Computing's roots trace back to the 60s. But it wasn't until Amazon launched its Elastic Compute Cloud in 2006 that the term became a buzzword. Since then, it's been on an upward trend.\nWhy is Cloud Computing Important?\nSource: Cloud Hosting Cloudoye\nCloud computing enhances business efficiency, scalability, and global communication by offering flexible, cost-effective, and real-time solutions.\nBusiness Benefits of Cloud Computing\nCloud Computing is like a Swiss army knife for businesses.
