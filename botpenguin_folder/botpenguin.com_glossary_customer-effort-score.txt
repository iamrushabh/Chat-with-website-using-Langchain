Definition of Customer Effort Score
Customer Effort Score (CES) is a way to find out how easy it is for customers to interact with a business. Instead of asking if they are happy, it asks if things are simple and smooth. This score can tell a lot about how well a business is doing in making things easy for its customers.
Customer Effort Score Calculation
Image source: blog.hubspot.com
For customer effort score calculation, customers are typically asked to respond to a single survey question such as, "How easy was it to handle your issue today?" Responses are given on a scale, usually from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates very high effort, and 5 indicates very low effort. Alternatively, a scale from 1 to 7 or 1 to 10 may be used. The responses are then averaged to get the CES.
The customer effort score formula for calculating CES is straightforward:
Customer Effort Score (Formula)
= ∑(individual customer effort scores)/total number of responses​
For instance, if five customers rate their effort levels as 3, 4, 2, 5, and 3, the customer effort score calculation would be as follows:
Customer Effort Score
= 3+4+2+5+3/5 = 17/5 = 3.4
A lower customer effort score calculation indicates that customers perceive their interactions as requiring less effort, which is positive for the company. Conversely, a higher customer effort score calculation suggests that customers find the processes cumbersome. Thus highlighting areas where improvements are necessary to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Components of a Customer Effort Score Survey
The components of a customer effort score survey are the following:
Question Design
Designing a
Customer Effort Score
survey starts with a simple question. You want to know how easy it was for the customer to achieve their goal. Ask something like, "How easy was it to solve your issue today?" Keep it straightforward. This question should be clear and to the point, so customers understand exactly what you're asking.
Rating Scale
Image source: monkeylearn.com
Next, include a rating scale. This helps you measure the effort in a way that’s easy to analyze. A common scale is from 1 to 5, where 1 means "very easy" and 5 means "very difficult." This simple scale makes it easy for customers to respond quickly. They don’t have to think too hard about their answer, which is the goal. You want their immediate reaction.
Follow-up Questions

After the main question and rating, it’s helpful to ask a follow-up. This can provide more context to their score. For example, if someone rates their experience as difficult, ask why. A question like, "What made your experience difficult?" can give you valuable insights. Keep follow-up questions short and specific. This way, you get the information you need without overwhelming the customer.
Importance of Clarity
Clarity is crucial in a
Customer Effort Score
survey. If the questions are confusing, the responses will be unreliable. Use simple words and keep sentences short. The goal is to get honest and immediate feedback from your customers. They should be able to answer quickly without having to think too much about what you’re asking.
Timing and Placement
Consider when and where you present the survey. Right after a customer interaction is ideal. If they’ve just completed a purchase or finished a support call, they can easily recall their experience. Place the survey where it's convenient, like in a follow-up email or as a pop-up on your website. This ensures higher response rates and more accurate data.

Analyzing Results

Once you have the responses, analyze them to find patterns. Look for common issues that made the experience difficult. This helps you understand where to focus your efforts. If many customers rate their experience as difficult, dig deeper into those interactions. Find out what went wrong and how you can fix it.
Making Improvements
Use the insights from your
Customer Effort Score
survey to make improvements. If customers find a particular process hard, simplify it. If a website feature is confusing, redesign it to be more user-friendly. The goal is to reduce effort and make every interaction smoother for your customers.
