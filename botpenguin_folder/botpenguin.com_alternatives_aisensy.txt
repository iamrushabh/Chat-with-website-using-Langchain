Why do you need an AiSensy alternative?
Pricing: AiSensy costs $130 for the basic plan and $300 for the professional plan annually. It’s a bit heavy on your budget.
Lagging Issues: AiSensy slows down under large message volumes, which can hamper your services temporarily.
Only WhatsApp: AiSensy provides a WhatsApp website widget, but it's not omni-channel. It lacks access to platforms like landing pages, Telegram, Facebook, etc.
Trigger Failure: Sometimes the message triggers may not work, and your set automation will not fire, missing out on conversion opportunities.
Limited Native Integrations: AiSensy lacks native integrations, limiting you from connecting your chatbot to various 3rd party or custom applications.
Limited Customizations: AiSensy may prevent you from fully customizing the chatbot's appearance and behavior to align with your brand and business needs.
