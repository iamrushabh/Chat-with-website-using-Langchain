finding the information they need? Have you considered implementing a live chat widget to improve customer support and business growth? If you still need to, you're taking advantage of a valuable opportunity to engage with your audience in real-time.\nFor a good reason, live chat software has become an increasingly popular way to interact between businesses and customers. According to a study by Comm100, customers who engage with a business through live chat are three times more likely to purchase. Additionally, 82% of customers report being satisfied with their live chat experience, making it a valuable tool for improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nBut what exactly is a live chat widget? Simply put, it is a feature on your website that allows visitors to initiate a conversation with your support team in real-time. It's like having a personal assistant available to respond to questions and provide assistance around the clock. And the benefits continue beyond there.\nA live chat widget can improve website conversion rates, reduce response times, and provide valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences.\nIn this article, we'll walk you through establishing a live chat widget for your website.\nWe'll go through everything you need to know about creating a successful live chat widget, from selecting the correct live chat software to developing an aesthetically beautiful and user-friendly gadget.\nSo, let's get this party started!\nWhat is a live chat widget?\nA live chat widget is a feature or component added to a website to enable real-time communication between website visitors and a business's support team or customer service representatives. It usually appears as a small chat box or window that visitors can interact with to ask questions, seek assistance, or engage in conversations with the support team.\nThe\nlive chat widget\nallows visitors to initiate a chat session by clicking on the widget, which opens up a chat interface. Visitors can type messages through this interface, and the support team can respond quickly. The widget often includes features such as chat history, file-sharing capabilities, and sometimes even automated chatbots to assist with common queries.\nConnect, Engage, Convert\nGet Started FREE\nDifferent types of live chat widgets\nSeveral types of live chat widgets are available, including\nEmbedded widgets\n:\u00a0These widgets are integrated into the layout of your website and are constantly visible on one or multiple pages.

Embedded widgets allow visitors to initiate a chat at any time while browsing your website, as the chat interface is readily available.\nPop-up widgets\n:\u00a0Pop-up widgets, as the name suggests, appear as a pop-up window when a visitor clicks on a specific button, icon, or link on your website.
