What is Hyperautomation?
In the simplest terms, hyperautomation is the application of advanced automation technologies and techniques, primarily artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to ramp up business processes.
It implies an automation strategy that goes beyond traditional rule-based automation, integrating AI with Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to perform tasks that generally need human intelligence.
Hyperautomation vs Automation
Whereas traditional automation confines itself within
rule-based tasks
with predictable outcomes, hyperautomation probes into a wider range of processes. It tackles complex and non-routine tasks, benefiting tremendously from
AI
capabilities to process
unstructured data
, make decisions, and learn from experiences.
Driving Forces of Hyperautomation
What fuels hyperautomation? Let’s break it down:
Technological Advancements
The rise and evolution of
AI
, ML, and other advanced technologies have been instrumental driving forces behind hyperautomation. Their capability to understand, learn, and perform tasks on their own has overhauled process automation, thus catapulting hyperautomation to the prominence it enjoys today.
Business Process Improvement
Hyperautomation often serves as an answer to business process improvement, reducing time-consuming manual labor, diminishing process errors, and fostering scalability. By automating complex tasks, hyperautomation allows employees to channel their effort and time toward more value-added work.

Key Components of Hyperautomation
In the heart of hyperautomation lie a few key components that make it what it is. Here’s what they are:
Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
RPA is the cornerstone of hyperautomation, providing the necessary base for automating repetitive,
rule-based tasks.
However, when it collaborates with AI and ML, it matures, graduating RPA to hyperautomation and enabling automation for a wider array of processes.

training to work
alongside these advanced systems, which can act as a hurdle for many businesses, particularly smaller ones.
