Why should you seek Chatfuel alternatives?
Pricing: Chatfuel pricing is a maze. First, you pay for the lite version, then for Facebook & Instagram, and then for WhatsApp. The final cost is off the roofs.
No WooCommerce: Chatfuel lacks a native WooCommerce integration, the most popular eCommerce platform.
Paid Integrations: First, Chatfuel has a limited number of native integrations, and to make matters worse, it charges $100-150 to set up those integrations.
Paid Customization: To build a chatbot for specific business use cases like lead generation, FAQs, Sales, etc., you must pay $150. Chatfuel alternatives like BotPenguin offer this customization for free.
Limited Scalability: Chatfuel may not be ideal for businesses expecting rapid growth or high traffic as scaling can be costly and require extra development.
Charge Per Conversion: Chatfuel charges you a fractional amount for each conversion after the set limit. It can add up to a lot if you have a high conversion rate.

Success is a long journey. Choose efficient fuel; choose BotPenguin.
