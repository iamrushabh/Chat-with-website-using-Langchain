Determine the desired tone (e.g., friendly, professional, witty) based on your brand values and user demographics.
Develop a unique voice by incorporating specific language, phrasing, and vocabulary that align with your brand and audience.
Create guidelines for your chatbot's tone and voice to ensure consistency across all interactions.
