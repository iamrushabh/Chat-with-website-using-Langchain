How to Set Up a Squarespace Chatbot?
Step 1
Choose a Compatible Chatbot Platform
First, select a chatbot platform that works seamlessly with Squarespace, such as
BotPenguin
, MobileMonkey, or Tars. These platforms offer user-friendly interfaces and customization options to create the perfect chatbot for your website.

Step 3
Generate and Embed the Chatbot Script
Once your chatbot is ready, the platform will provide a script or code snippet. Copy this code and head to your Squarespace website editor. Navigate to the settings or custom code injection area, and paste the chatbot script into the appropriate section. This will embed the chatbot on your website.
Step 4
Test and Optimize your Chatbot
After embedding the chatbot, test its functionality and responsiveness on your website. Ensure it works smoothly across different devices and browsers. Gather user feedback and analytics data to optimize your chatbot's performance and improve the user experience over time.
