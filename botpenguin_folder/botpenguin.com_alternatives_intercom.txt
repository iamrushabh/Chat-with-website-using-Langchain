Why you need an Intercom alternative today!
High Pricing: Intercom chatbot charges you based on seats. For a seat, the Essential plan costs $39, the Advanced costs $99, and the Expert costs $139 monthly.
Limited Channels: The landing page and Telegram chatbots are not included in Intercom’s multi-channel bots.
Not exactly a Chatbot: Intercom is primarily a help desk and ticketing system. You don’t need its extra features if you already use a CRM.
No Free Plan: There’s no free plan for users to test Intercom’s features. Only a free trial is available with credit card details, of course!
Limited scalability: Small businesses are deterred from upgrading their plans to match business scale simply because it is too expensive.
Lacks Custom Reporting: Intercom lacks dashboard customization to monitor business-specific metrics for your chatbots.
