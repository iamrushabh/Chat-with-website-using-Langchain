Providers\n3PLs provide outsourced logistics services, which include warehousing, order fulfillment, and shipping for ecommerce businesses.\nFulfillment Centers\nWhether owned by the business, a 3PL or a marketplace, these warehouses play a central role in the storage, packing, shipment, and return of products.\nCustomers\nCustomers form the end of the order fulfillment process, and their
