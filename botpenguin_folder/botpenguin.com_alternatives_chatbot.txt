You need a Chatbot.com alternative today!
Pricing: Chatbot.com pricing is off the charts. It costs a staggering $624 per year, which is not a suitable deal for small businesses.
No Native Live Chat: It doesn’t have a native live chat, so it offers integration with the LiveChat platform, leading to added pricing.
Restricted Scalability: Chatbot.com may not be scalable for high-traffic businesses. Upgrading plans could add costs and may lack flexibility for growth.
No attachments in Chat: With chatbot.com, you can’t send files like PDFs and Videos to your customers for better retention.
No Broadcast and Sequences: Chatbot.com lacks the feature to set up broadcasts and drip campaigns to boost your marketing effort.
