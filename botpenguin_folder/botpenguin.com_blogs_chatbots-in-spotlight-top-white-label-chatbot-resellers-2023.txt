If you were to ask me what’s better than using a chatbot, I would say selling one. You have a chance to enter the 7 billion chatbot market with zero research and development costs.
Sounds too good to be true?
Well, that’s a white label chatbot program for you. You can purchase a ready-made or customized Chabot agency platform and sell chatbot services under your brand name.
Think about it: As a whitelabel chatbot reseller, you can become an AI chatbot provider and automate custom interactions for millions of businesses worldwide.
That’s the easy part. Finding the perfect chatbot program is a tough road because when buying an already-built platform, ensuring it meets the client’s needs becomes much more important.
In this article, I’ll list the Top White label Chatbots of 2024 and the features you need to watch out for.
So, let’s dive in.
What is a White Label Chatbot?
White label chatbots are pre-built chatbots that you can customize and brand as your own.
They remove the original developer's branding, allowing you to add your logo and sell them under your company name. This approach helps small businesses enter the chatbot market without developing their platform.
Not just branding, you can customize your set of features & integrations, control the pricing with tailored subscription plans, onboard users at your terms, and more.
An established AI chatbot platform with a while-label program will allow you to sell branded chatbot solutions for websites, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and many other channels.
Add AI to the mix, and you have a ChatGPT-driven chatbot that delivers a conversational experience across your client’s business.
Again, it depends solely on the whitelabel chatbot provider. Hence, finding the right one is a critical decision.
Why Do You Need a White Label Chatbot Platform?
Nowadays, businesses seek ways to engage their customers effectively without putting pressure on their employees. Chatbots can be an excellent solution.
Whitelabel Chatbot platforms are power pack tools at affordable prices. Plus, the margin for resellers is huge.
Whitelabel chatbots
are easy to sell to your customers, and you can guarantee them immediate benefits.
White label chatbot resellers must allocate all their efforts to marketing only. The service provider handles the extensive product development, routine updates, and support.
They can be instantly built, branded, and executed to fit any business chatbot demand.
Cost-Effectiveness
White label chatbot
platforms offer significant benefits, including cost-effectiveness and quick deployment. Unlike the traditional route, which requires a large investment to develop a chatbot platform, resellers face no such hassle.
These wallet-friendly services provide a fully developed platform with your branding, pricing, logos, and features. This enables you to enter the growing chatbot market easily.
Multiple Subscription Packages
See Full Pricing
White label chatbot platforms have pre-built subscription plans whose pricing you can edit and change according to your needs.
These plans are suitable for small to big businesses so that everybody can equally access them to grow their business and attract more customers.
Managed-Training, Support, and Development
The
White label chatbot service provider
manages all the technical aspects like training your team, new feature development, and client support.
Outsourcing your support team clearly benefits you because chatbot experts with years of experience handle your clients’ issues.
This leaves you with only one job — marketing. Promote, sell, and make it rain money.
Earn Revenue With Chatbot & its Addons
Whitelabel chatbots are, in essence, chatbots. They will sell like hotcakes during Halloween. If you follow a subscription model, you’ll receive money monthly and yearly on a routine basis.
Plus, you can sell add-ons of message packs, integrations, channels, etc., to increase the overall price.
Enter the Chatbot Market in No Time
As the whitelabel chatbot reseller, you can begin your journey in a few days if you don’t have any customizations for the white label provider.
In ideal cases, you can launch your branded chatbot platform within 24 hours. It is a shortcut where you only have to work on building a brand and onboarding users.
Your Chatbot Platform Reflects Your Vision
White label chatbot resellers can customize the bot platform with their brand name to meet their clients' demands.
For example, suppose you want a different set of features and integration to improve the product’s saleability to your target audience. In that case, the solution provider will develop a unique version of the chatbot platform for you.
Now, let’s move on to the money part.
