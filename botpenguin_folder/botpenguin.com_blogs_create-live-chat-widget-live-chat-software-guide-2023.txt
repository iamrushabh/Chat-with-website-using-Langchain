Introduction
Do you want to avoid losing potential customers on your website because they need help finding the information they need? Have you considered implementing a live chat widget to improve customer support and business growth? If you still need to, you're taking advantage of a valuable opportunity to engage with your audience in real-time.
For a good reason, live chat software has become an increasingly popular way to interact between businesses and customers. According to a study by Comm100, customers who engage with a business through live chat are three times more likely to purchase. Additionally, 82% of customers report being satisfied with their live chat experience, making it a valuable tool for improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.
But what exactly is a live chat widget? Simply put, it is a feature on your website that allows visitors to initiate a conversation with your support team in real-time. It's like having a personal assistant available to respond to questions and provide assistance around the clock. And the benefits continue beyond there.
A live chat widget can improve website conversion rates, reduce response times, and provide valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences.
In this article, we'll walk you through establishing a live chat widget for your website.
We'll go through everything you need to know about creating a successful live chat widget, from selecting the correct live chat software to developing an aesthetically beautiful and user-friendly gadget.
So, let's get this party started!
What is a live chat widget?
A live chat widget is a feature or component added to a website to enable real-time communication between website visitors and a business's support team or customer service representatives. It usually appears as a small chat box or window that visitors can interact with to ask questions, seek assistance, or engage in conversations with the support team.
The
live chat widget
allows visitors to initiate a chat session by clicking on the widget, which opens up a chat interface. Visitors can type messages through this interface, and the support team can respond quickly. The widget often includes features such as chat history, file-sharing capabilities, and sometimes even automated chatbots to assist with common queries.

Different types of live chat widgets
Several types of live chat widgets are available, including
Embedded widgets
: These widgets are integrated into the layout of your website and are constantly visible on one or multiple pages. They typically appear as a chat box or icon in a fixed position, such as in the corner of the screen or along the side. Embedded widgets allow visitors to initiate a chat at any time while browsing your website, as the chat interface is readily available.
Pop-up widgets
: Pop-up widgets, as the name suggests, appear as a pop-up window when a visitor clicks on a specific button, icon, or link on your website. This button or icon often indicates that live chat support is available. Pop-up widgets grab the visitor's attention by displaying the chat interface in a separate window, focusing their attention on the conversation.
Slide-in widgets
: Slide-in widgets are designed to slide into view from the bottom or side of the screen as a visitor scrolls or navigates through your website. These widgets are typically less intrusive than pop-up windows but still capture visitors' attention. Slide-in widgets allow visitors to initiate a chat by clicking on the widget as it becomes visible.
Each type of live chat widget has advantages and can be chosen based on your website's design, user experience preferences, and the level of visibility or attention you want to give to the chat functionality. Ultimately, the goal is to provide an easily accessible and engaging chat experience for your website visitors.
How does a live chat widget work?
When visitors initiate a chat, they are connected to a member of your support team who can answer their questions and provide assistance. Live chat widgets often come with features such as chat history, canned responses, and chat routing, allowing you to manage multiple chats simultaneously and provide fast and efficient support.
A customized live chat widget can help you stand out from the competition and create a unique brand experience for your visitors. A customized widget lets you choose colors, fonts, and styles matching your brand's personality and values, making it more visually appealing and recognizable. Additionally, a customized widget can help you better target your audience and provide a more personalized experience for each visitor.
