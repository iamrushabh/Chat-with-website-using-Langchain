It can be performed in-house by the business, outsourced to a third-party logistics (3PL) company, or fulfilled by the marketplace (like Amazon FBA).

customer service
related to shipments, and manage returns effectively.

Who is Involved in Ecommerce Fulfillment?
Several key players contribute to the ecommerce fulfillment ecosystem.
Online Retailers
These are the businesses selling products online and may handle fulfillment themselves or outsource it to a 3PL.
Third-Party Logistics (3PL) Providers
3PLs provide outsourced logistics services, which include warehousing, order fulfillment, and shipping for ecommerce businesses.
Fulfillment Centers
Whether owned by the business, a 3PL or a marketplace, these warehouses play a central role in the storage, packing, shipment, and return of products.
Customers
Customers form the end of the order fulfillment process, and their satisfaction hugely determines the effectiveness of the entire operation.
Delivery Service Providers
These are the carriers responsible for transporting the order from the warehouse to the customer’s location.
When Does Ecommerce Fulfillment Occur?
The following sections explain the timeframes and stages in ecommerce fulfillment.
Pre-Sales
The fulfillment process effectively begins even before a sale occurs with inventory management, warehousing, and
logistics planning
.
Post-Sales
Once a sale is made online, the order is processed, packed, and shipped to the customer. Tracking information is typically provided post-sales.
On-Demand
Some fulfillment processes, such as on-demand manufacturing or dropshipping, commence only after the order is placed.
Continuous
Certain activities, like inventory replenishment and warehouse maintenance, are ongoing to ensure a smooth fulfillment process.
Post-Delivery
Fulfillment extends beyond delivery, as handling returns, exchanges, and customer queries forms part of the process.
Where Can Ecommerce Fulfillment Take Place?
Ecommerce fulfillment can operate in diverse contexts and locations based on the business strategy and customer demographics.
In-House Fulfillment
Smaller businesses may conduct fulfillment operations from their existing premises or dedicated storage spaces.
Third-Party Fulfillment Centers
These are independent facilities where multiple businesses can store their products, with the center handling fulfillment on their behalf.
Marketplace Fulfillment Centers
Major ecommerce platforms run their own fulfillment centers (e.g., Amazon FBA), providing services from storage to customer service for sellers on their platform.
Dropshipping
In this model, the seller doesn't handle any stock. Instead, orders are forwarded to a supplier who ships the products directly to the customer.
Hybrid Approach
A mix of the above options can be used based on the size of operation, product types, and market presence.
How is Ecommerce Fulfillment Achieved?
This part underscores the process and techniques used in ecommerce fulfillment.
Inventory Management
Effective inventory management ensures optimal stock levels, reducing storage costs and preventing stock-outs or oversupply.
Order Processing
Once an order is received, it is picked from the inventory, packed with essential product and shipping information, and made ready for dispatch.
Shipping and Delivery
Orders are then handed over to courier services for delivery. Transit times depend on shipping methods and customer location.
Returns and Exchanges
A clear and easy returns and exchanges policy forms part of good fulfillment practice, fostering customer trust and satisfaction.
Customer Service
Providing prompt and helpful
customer service
, especially regarding order queries, shipment tracking, and returns, strengthens the fulfillment process.
Technological Integration in Ecommerce Fulfillment
Technology plays an enormous role in enhancing and streamlining ecommerce fulfillment.
Inventory Management Software
These systems track stock levels, sales trends, and provide valuable insights for inventory planning and optimization.
Order Management Systems
OMS allows efficient handling of orders across multiple sales channels and ensures that shipping and customer information is accurately processed.
Shipping Software
Shipping software simplifies the process of selecting courier services, calculating shipping costs, and printing shipping labels.
Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
CRM
systems enable effective communication with customers throughout the fulfillment process and efficient handling of customer issues.
Automation
Advancements in robotics and
AI
are increasingly used in fulfillment centers for activities like picking, packing, and sorting, increasing accuracy and efficiency.
