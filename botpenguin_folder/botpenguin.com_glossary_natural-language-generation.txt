What is Natural Language Generation?
Natural Language Generation is a type of AI-powered technology that converts structured data into human-like language. It is used in a wide range of applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to business intelligence and report generation. NLG works by taking structured data as input and generating natural language output that is easy for humans to read and understand.
NLG vs NLU vs NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP), Natural Language Generation (NLG), and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) are three pivotal fields within artificial intelligence (AI) that focus on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP is an interdisciplinary field that combines linguistics, computer science, and AI to enable machines to process, analyze, and understand human language. It encompasses a broad range of functionalities such as text analysis, language translation, and sentiment analysis. NLP serves as an umbrella term that includes both NLG and NLU.

Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
NLU is a subset of NLP that focuses on the comprehension aspect. It involves the machine’s ability to understand the context, sentiment, and intent behind the text input.
NLU is crucial
for tasks such as intent recognition in chatbots, question answering systems, and understanding human emotions through text.
Natural Language Generation (NLG)
NLG, another subset of NLP, involves the generation of human-like text by computers. It converts structured data into natural language. NLG is widely used in applications such as chatbots for generating responses, automated report writing, and creating written content from
data sets
.
The Interplay and Distinctions
While both NLU and NLG fall under the
NLP umbrella
, they serve different purposes. NLU is concerned with understanding the input, whereas NLG focuses on generating meaningful output. Often, systems combine both to facilitate complete interaction; for example, a chatbot may use NLU to understand a user’s query and NLG to generate a response.
Applications and Significance
The integration of NLP, NLU, and NLG is revolutionizing numerous industries. For instance, in healthcare,
NLP
is used for processing clinical notes, NLU helps in understanding patients’ queries, and NLG creates personalized health reports. These technologies are also extensively used in customer service, content creation, language translation, and numerous other fields.
How does Natural Language Generation (NLG) Work?
Natural Language Generation (NLG) uses algorithms to convert data into human-readable text, enabling computers to generate written content.
Data Preparation
Before generating text, the NLG system needs to gather and process the data it will use as input. This data can come from various sources such as databases, spreadsheets, or APIs. The system then organizes the data into a structured format, which can be easily understood by the NLG
algorithms
.
Template-Based Approaches
One common method for NLG is the template-based approach, which involves pre-defined text templates with placeholders for specific data points. The NLG system replaces these placeholders with the relevant data from the structured input. This method is simple and efficient, but it may lack the flexibility and creativity of more advanced techniques.
Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques
More sophisticated NLG systems use statistical and machine learning methods to generate text. These techniques analyze large datasets of human-generated text to learn patterns, grammar rules, and linguistic structures. They then use this knowledge to create new, original text based on the input data. Examples of such techniques include n-gram models, hidden Markov models, and
neural networks
.
Deep Learning and Neural Networks
Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has revolutionized NLG with the development of advanced neural networks like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformer models. These models can generate more natural and coherent text by capturing complex language patterns and context. Popular examples of deep learning-based NLG systems include OpenAI's GPT-3 and Google's BERT.
Evaluation and Improvement
To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the generated text, NLG systems are continuously evaluated and improved. This can involve human evaluation, where experts assess the text's readability, relevance, and grammaticality, or automated evaluation using metrics like BLEU and ROUGE. The feedback from these evaluations is then used to refine the NLG
algorithms
, resulting in better text generation over time.
In conclusion, NLG is a fascinating field that combines data processing, machine learning, and linguistic knowledge to create human-like text. With advancements in AI and deep learning, NLG systems are becoming more capable of generating natural, engaging, and informative content.
Types of NLG
Types of NLG: Rule-based NLG, Template-based NLG, Statistical NLG, Hybrid NLG, Neural NLG, and Deep NLG are different approaches to generate natural language text.
Template-based NLG
Template-based NLG is one of the most basic types of natural language generation. It involves using predefined templates with placeholders for data. These templates are usually created manually by developers or content specialists. For instance, weather report generation can use templates like “The temperature in [City] is [Temperature] degrees.” This approach is easy to implement but lacks flexibility.
Statistical NLG
Statistical NLG uses statistical models to generate text. These models are typically trained on
large datasets
and rely on patterns and probabilities to construct sentences. This type of NLG is more adaptable compared to template-based, as it can generate a wider range of sentences. However, the quality of the generated text can be inconsistent.
Rule-based NLG
Rule-based NLG is built upon a set of linguistic rules. These rules define the grammar and structure of the language. Developers and linguists manually create rules that guide how the system generates text. For example, rules can specify how to convert data into text, or how to structure sentences. Rule-based systems are often used in applications where precision and control over language are essential.
Neural NLG
Neural NLG leverages deep learning, particularly neural networks, to generate text. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers are commonly used architectures in Neural NLG. This type has gained popularity for its ability to produce more natural and coherent text.
GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
is an example of a model using this approach.
Hybrid NLG
Hybrid NLG combines elements from the aforementioned types. For example, it might use templates for specific parts of the content, and neural networks for other parts. Hybrid systems attempt to capitalize on the strengths of different NLG approaches, and are often employed in complex applications where high quality and diverse content is desired.
Why use Natural Language Generation?
Enhancing User Experience
Natural Language Generation (NLG) can create human-like, contextually relevant content, enabling more engaging and personalized interactions with users.
Streamlining Content Creation
NLG automates the process of generating text, saving time and resources while still producing high-quality, creative, and diverse content for various platforms.
Simplifying Data Visualization
NLG can transform complex data into easily understandable narratives, making it simpler for users to grasp insights and trends without requiring extensive data analysis skills.
Boosting Personalization and Customization
NLG systems can tailor content to individual users, considering factors like preferences, past interactions, and demographics, resulting in a more personalized and relevant experience.
