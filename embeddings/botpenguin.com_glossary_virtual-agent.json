They can provide personalized assistance, offer recommendations, and even process transactions.\nDifferences between Virtual Agent and Chatbot\nWhile virtual agents and chatbots are similar, there are some differences between the two. Virtual agents are more advanced and can handle more complex inquiries, while chatbots are typically used for more basic tasks.\nVirtual Agent or Chatbot?

These rules help them navigate conversations and provide accurate, helpful information.
