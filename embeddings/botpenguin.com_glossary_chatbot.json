Let's talk about chatbots. A chatbot is a computer program designed to engage in conversation with humans through text or voice interactions.\nIt is also known as an\nAssistant Bot\nor\nSupport bot.\nThese nifty little helpers can answer questions, provide information, and even perform tasks, all while making your life a little bit easier.\nTypes of Chatbots\nThere are two main types of chatbots you might come across:\n1.

They can only understand and respond to specific commands, so if you go off-script, they might get a little confused. But hey, we all have our limitations, right?\n2. AI-powered Chatbots\nThese are the cool kids on the block. Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), they can understand natural language, learn from interactions, and get smarter over time. They're more versatile and can handle more complex conversations than their rule-based counterparts.\nWhy use a Chatbot?\nChatbots\ncan be a real game-changer for businesses. They help save time, reduce costs, and streamline processes. Plus, they're always available to lend a hand, 24/7. No coffee breaks or vacations for these hard workers!\n1.
